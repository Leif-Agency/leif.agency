We strive to help visitors make informed decisions. Without them having to jump through hoops, visit lots of links, click a thousand times and filter content to get to the information they are looking for.

We found that presenting information in highly targeted shortlists works best. Enriched with follow-up content for those who wish to take a deeper look at the material.

Whenever we create a shortlist, it starts out with a rough idea about the type of product we think could be interesting.
Each shortlist goes through various steps in a cycle, before it is then finally deployed to the live website.

#### Each Cycle involves:
 - Finding the top productsin a vertical for the new shortlist.
 - Gathering information for each product, from all over the internet.
 - If we do not have personal experience with any product, they are also tested by us, we give each product or service a good whirl.
 - Preparing what we found, bringing it all together in the form of written reviews.
 - Assigning an internal ranking of products, from best to worse according to our own impression.
 - Proof-reading, editorial checks.
 - And finally, uploading everything to our live site.

 This cycle is then repeated in irregular intervals, which is important to keep all of our shortlists maintained.

 Please note, the ranking of products can change for various reasons. One possible reason is simply that the product performs well for us, in a monetary fashion. Read more in our [Earnings Disclaimer]({{< relref "advertising-disclosure.md" >}}).

 Even though we are making money as a website, we still strive for absolute transparency and reserve our editorial integrity. What we write is what we feel, and has nothing to do with whether we're being paid.
