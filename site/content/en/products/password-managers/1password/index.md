1Password has the following features to make it easier than ever to keep track of and manage a large repository of login credentials:

Cross platform support and multiple browser extensions
Accidental deletion prevention thanks to 365 day password storage
No limits on stored passwords!

### Deleted Password Restore

Users are able to recover deleted credentials for 365 days after deletion. Therefore, users needn't worry about losing critical logins by accidentally deleting them—they will always be able to recover a copy. 

### Unlimited Passwords

With 1Password, users needn’t worry about the size of the vault they are storing. There is no limit to how many credentials can be saved—including secure notes—although there is a 1GB limit on document storage. 

### 2 Factor Authentication (2FA)

If there’s one thing the cybercrooks hate, it’s a login that is protected by two factor authentication (2FA). 2FA makes it very difficult to hack a login as users have to enter an additional One Time Password (OTP) in addition to the main access credential. Because users’ password vaults are especially vulnerable repositories of information, it’s vital that these be properly secured. 

### Team Sharing Features

Business users are able to subscribe to two plans made just for business. Enterprise users can avail of the Enterprise Plan which gives them a dedicated account manager and an onboarding engineer. All these plans allow users to share credentials internally with individual colleagues or with work groups. 

### Pre-Formatted Templates

1 Password has pre-formatted templates ready to go at the click of a button for all the most common credential types. These include secure notes, credit cards, SMTP server details, and email accounts. All users have to do is fill in the details.



### Granular Access Controls

Within the enterprise environment simple password management might not be enough for the auditors. That’s why 1 Password Business features detail audit logging and granular access control. Every internal password share and credential upload logged in the platform making it easy to prevent credential-leaking fraud and keep careful track of which team members have access to which functionalities. Administrative users can also create policies surrounding the minimum strength of passwords that can be used—and 1 Password will ensure that ever credential must meet that standard in order to be saved. Additionally, firewall rules can be created that allow or prevent sign-ins to business apps from certain IP addresses.

### Ease of Use

1 Password is not a difficult tool to set up. For end users all that is required is to download one of the company’s apps and to create an account. Once an account is set up, if it is part of a 1 Password Team or 1 Password Business organization then it will be able to access all credentials that have been shared with it. Administrative users can create and modify policies and user permissions through the cloud hosted database. Enterprise users can avail themselves of the services of a specialized onboarding engineer.

Detection Rates and Reliability

Thanks to its sophisticated algorithms, 1 Password is able to reliably judge the strength of passwords being used and warn against any password that is weak and liable to make the account vulnerable to being hacked.


### Business users:

For those that want to use the product as a group or in the business environment, there are three plans to choose from.

- Teams
- Business
- Enterprise

1Password Teams features the ability to share credentials among a team and access to 24/7 support. Those that upgrade to Business or Enterprise receive special VIP tier support, granular controls for credential policy setting, logging, and auditing, and custom security controls.

### Value for Money

1 Password is a very competitively priced solution — particularly for teams and families who can use one subscription for multiple devices. Relative to the devastating cost of a data breach, we think that the tool offers great value for money.

### Help and Support
