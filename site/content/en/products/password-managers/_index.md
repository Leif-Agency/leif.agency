# Why use a Password Manager?

We all have been there, trying to log in a website only to realize that we forgot the password.
Or was the username wrong, or the e-mail?

If you have a good Password Manager, this wonâ€™t ever happen to you again.

But Password Managers do a lot more than helping you with the above.

## How Password Managers Protect Your Privacy

Let's face it, any online service can get hacked and passwords can get leaked. It happens all the time. 

To make matters even worse, people often use a single password for many websites.

They use the same password for example:
- For their email account.
- For the online forum they like to hang out at.
- For that online game they like to play. 

**If one of these gets hacked, it is very likely that all the above accounts (and more) are now compromised.**

What people often fail to realize is, that a Hacker does not need to know you, or which websites you frequent. In fact most hackers do not target specific people at all.

Hackers make use of automated tools, which try to log into millions of websites.

Once they gained access to a list of passwords, amongst which your password could be. They would let their automated tools do all the dirty work. This of course means, a Hacker does not need to know if you use Gmail, Yahoo or Outlook for example.

These tools would try to log into all these websites in an automated fashion. If any website results in a successful login, that hacker could now log in and do whatever they wanted to.

Now this non-personal attack, could become a very targeted attack, **aimed at you**.

Imagine this evil hacker gained access to your email account, and downloads everything. Emails can often contain passwords for other websites or even your online banking. So you see, this could become a doomsday scenario in the blink of an eye.

Even if you try hard to manage all this yourself, and never use a password twice. There is a lot of room for error, it would be a huge amount of management work. And then you would still need a place where you write all these passwords down.

## But Can't Password Managers Also Get Hacked?
Yes, they definitely can. No online service is safe from such attacks.  

The difference is that Password Managers encrypt your entire Password library. Encryption results in your passwords, looking like scrambled text nonsense. **If a hacker gains access to this data, it is unusable**.

The only way to revert this military-grade encryption, is to use the master password that only you know.


## Using A Password Manager

Because you are now using a Password Manager, every single website account you create gets a unique password assigned.
This means you have a single point of failure, and not hundreds or even thousands.

If now one of these websites gets hacked, it will be only the one. You do not have to worry that the hacker gained access to any other account.

You are now confident that your privacy is well protected. Which means you can now also enjoy the other features any good Password Manager offers:  
- Autofill forms, credit card data when shopping
- Automatically logging you into websites
- Having all your passwords available on all your devices
- Receiving alerts if one of your passwords appeared in a data breach


Isn't all this much better than managing hundreds of passwords on post-it notes?
