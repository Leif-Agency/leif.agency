LastPass is developed by LogMeIn. The company was founded in Budapest, Hungary, although today its headquarters is in Boston.

### Ease of Use

Last Pass is very easy to set up. There are dedicated apps for Windows and Mac (the Windows app mostly installs the browser extensions although also installs a small standalone application). There are browser shortcuts for Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. Linux users can use the universal installer but are otherwise limited to using LastPass through the browser. 

### Reliability

LastPass is a versatile and reliable solution for password management. 

### Value

The basic LastPass is free. LastPass Premium provides some additional features. This includes the ability to share specific credentials with groups of users and emergency access features.

### Money Back Guarantee

Unfortunately, LastPass does not offer a money back guarantee. However, customers that are dissatisfied with any aspect of the product can get in touch with the company’s support to request a refund.

### Best For

Those that want to trust their password management to an established name with deep experience in the space.
Users that spend most of their workday in the browser—and that want a tool which can save them time by automatically entering passwords.
Users that want to delegate access to services they use to assistants and other users—while maintaining tight access control policies.

### Why Choose

LastPass makes it easy to store any type of credential securely—whether a driving license or a web login. Templates make capturing data straightforward. The company has also a stellar security record, having only experienced one minor security incident in its entire operating history—and no user data was affected.

### What LastPass Offers

LastPass Premium supports complete multifactor authentication. Users can use hardware 2FA devices such as the Yubikey and provide additional protection by storing the credential in Lastpass.

Premium also comes with 1GB of encrypted file storage space. Users can input and securely store key documentation — like Social Security Numbers (SSNs) — in the main interface while keeping digital scans of the documentation within the encrypted storage area.

Windows users get complete autofill, saving them countless minutes per day manually inputting user credentials. The system uses virtual keystrokes to instantaneously populate the right boxes. Users can even manually assign irregular pieces of entry information if they are not automatically detected.

### Features

#### Total Encryption

Worried that LastPass employees might be snooping on your log in credentials? They couldn’t even if they wanted to. LastPass credentials are encrypted at the local (device) level, which is why a master password is required to access the vault.

#### Autofill

Tired of typing in your username and password countless times each day? LastPass’s autofill technology automatically populates your credentials to save you time and frustration. In fact, every time you sign in to a service, you can ask LastPass to remind you whether you would like it to store the credential in the password vault.

#### Digital Wallet

LastPass is smart enough to know which of your saved credentials represent payment methods and provides users with an option of which to use during the checkout process from online merchants. Users can also configure payment profiles and tie them to certain websites. For instance, one could associate a corporate credit card with a B2B purchasing platform and a personal card with a consumer site.

### Ease of Use

LastPass is easy to set up and use. Windows, Mac, and Linux users can all download the main installer application which will prompt them to also install add-ons for the web browsers that they use (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Microsoft Edge are all supported). 

To begin saving credentials to the password vault, users can either follow the automatic prompts to save the information or manually access the value and input the details themselves.

### Reliability

How reliable is LastPass?

Naturally, data breaches are of concern to anybody that is entrusting a cloud-hosted provider with their most sensitive personal information.  Here’s some information to reassure.

LastPass operates on a strict zero knowledge security model. Data stored by LastPass users is encrypted at the device level — on their computers. The company has had one minor security incident in its entire operating history — which did not result in the compromising of any customer data. 

The password manager is used extensively in industry — including by many Fortune 500 enterprises. We think that your data is probably safe in LastPass’s Vault! 

### Value for Money

LastPass offers significant functionalities that can help safeguard personal data — or that of a business. The cost of data breaches are massive — the average cost in the US has risen to almost $4 million. For that reason alone, we think that the $3/month subscription cost to avail of the advanced functionalities that LastPass Premium supports is strong value for money.

### Help and Support

Users that run into trouble can avail of LastPass’s extensive online documentation which contains tutorials for both routine issues like logging into the account as well as more advanced ones such as adding multifactor authentication login protection.

Customers that need personalized support can do so by opening a support ticket. Premium users receive priority attention.

### Bottom Line

LastPass remains an excellent choice of password manager for both private users and commercial ones. Premium users can avail of one to many credential sharing, while those on a family plan can enjoy discounted access for many family members and a family dashboard. For the value delivered, it’s a product worth purchasing.
