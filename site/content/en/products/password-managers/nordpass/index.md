NordPass is a fully owned brand name of NordVPN which is based in the Republic of Panama. The company was founded in 2008.

### Why Choose

NordPass is the password management tool brought to market by the same people that make Nord VPN. This isn’t the most sophisticated password management tool in existence, but it does have a very quick and easy to use user interface. While you won’t find advanced fields for storing things like driving licenses, if all you need to do is capture some saved credit card details and create a few secure stored notes then NordPass has all the functionality that you will need. And as an added advantage: there are extensions available for four different browsers!

### What NordPass Offers

Credential Storing and Automatic Save Prompts 

NordPass offers basic password saving features to allow users to memorialize all their login credentials in one secure online vault that is protected by industry standard encryption.

The tool itself consists of two parts. On the one hand, there are browser extensions that allow users to save credentials—and which can populate them into the right fields at the click of a button.


### Share Passwords With Colleagues

If you need to share saved credentials with a family member, then all you need to do with NordPass is click on a few buttons and the login will appear in the other user’s NordPass account.


This feature is only available on the Premium plans, however—so it’s another good reason to go for the upgrade.

Push Your Desktop Passwords Online

NordPass isn’t only capable of saving your online login credentials, however. The tool also offers a number of desktop background services—including one for Ubuntu that can be installed by simply running a Bash script after extracting the download folder. 


The service will automatically push saved credentials to the cloud. These can be shared with colleagues just as if they were a login to a web program. 

Finally, NordPass also offers autocomplete and password prompt functionalities. If you are at the login page of a service with a stored credential, then the browser extension will automatically present the credential to the user—who only needs to click on the credential in order to fill it out.


This is unlike several other password managers in which users need to manually enter the login URL for the system to work automatically.

### Quickly Import From Other Password Managers And Browsers

If you’re currently using another password management tool—such as LastPass or Dashlane—then there’s no need to have to go through the painstaking process of manually copying over login credentials.

Instead, NordPass has developed a series of automatic importers for a wide variety of browser and competitor password managers.

The list of supported services includes:

The following password managers:

RoboForm
Keeper
BitWarden
KeePassX, a popular cross-platform desktop password manager
LastPass
1Password

The following browsers are supported:

Chrome
Firefox
Opera

Additionally, users have the option to upload a comma separated values (CSV) file if the only way they have their credentials stored is on a datasheet.


### Passwords Are Safe Thanks to Zero Knowledge Architecture

Nord proudly advertises that it uses zero-knowledge architecture (also sometimes called zero proof architecture) in order to securely save users’ credentials on its servers.


This means that the company’s own teams do not have raw (human readable) access to users’ stored credentials. Instead, they are encrypted locally so that on that they would only be visible in the case of a manual compliance request. 

For users that are worried about Nord employees being able to access the things they save online it should be a relief to know that from a technical standpoint this simply isn’t possible.


### Ease of Use

NordPass is a very simple tool to use. There are two main components to it—the browser extension and the desktop sync client. 

Installing the browser extensions—available for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Microsoft Edge—is quick and easy as the download links are all conveniently situated within the online account management portal.


Of course, users are also able to install them directly themselves by accessing the browsers’ online app markets.

Additionally, download links for the various desktop sync tools are also in the online management area too—as well as the link for NordLocker, which is available for Windows and macOS.


We installed the desktop sync client for Ubuntu and installed it seamlessly on a test machine running the latest distro, 19.10. 

### Detection Rates

NordPass is able to detect and upload all identifiable credentials—irrespective of whether they come from online or offline sources. 

Additionally, the tool can automatically generate usernames and passwords that are extremely strong and which would be extremely difficult to crack by brute force methods.

### Help and Support

Although we thought that NordPass was easy to use, it’s invariably true that some users will get stuck and need help. Thankfully, the company didn’t disappoint in this respect.

The cornerstone of its online support operation is the NordPass Help Center. This is a very well filled knowledge base which contains excellent tutorials for all of the supported operating systems and extensions.


The company has put together detailed tutorials along with screenshots for even the most specific of use-cases—such as using the Chrome extension on a computer running a Linux distribution.


If you require personalized support then it is available by email, and thankfully the team has a reputation for being highly responsive.

### Bottom Line

Need a password manager with all the bells and whistles? Some competitors offer more of these. Personally, we thought that NordPass did a great job at providing all the functionalities that the vast majority of users will ever need. It’s a fast, sleek tool with great cross-platform support, and has a great knowledge-base to match. Highly recommended!
