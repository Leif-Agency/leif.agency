Given that the product is fronted by the same iconic bear that TunnelBear VPN users are surely familiar with, it should come as no surprise to find out that RememBear is operated by the same company, TunnelBear, which was acquired by McAfee. The company is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario—a location it refers to as the ‘Bear Cave’.


RememBear is a great password manager for users that have simple requirements—like storing passwords! While it does not offer some more powerful features such as reminding users to choose a new password or rating the cryptographic strength of a selected password, it does contain a very slick user interface for storing passwords through the desktop client and browser add-ons. If you have the right peripherals, it can also work with face and fingerprint ID.

### Why Choose RememBear

What’s worse than not having a password manager? Having a password manager that’s too complicated to use! RememBear strikes the perfect balance between being a capable tool for managing passwords while also not overwhelming users with sophisticated features that they are unlikely to have a use for.

### What RememBear Offers

Autocompletion: RememBear will automatically enter credentials when a user visits a website that matches a saved credential. This saves countless time spent entering usernames and passwords.

Encryption: All passwords are saved on the cloud using military strength AES256 encryption.

Desktop and mobile clients: RememBear can be accessed by desktop clients for Windows and Mac and by smartphone clients for iOS and Android (these work on tablets too). The only platform missing from RememBear’s repertoire, in fact, is Linux.

Password Vault: RememBear gives users a password vault that is divided into saved logins and secure notes. It also features a password generator.

### Features

#### Password Manager and Vault
RememBear’s main feature is its password vault manager which is a program containing all users' saved credentials. This is divided into separate sections according to the type of logins that users store there including:

#### Login credentials
Secure notes
Credit cards
Users are able to enter and edit credentials for each saved service including the login website, its name in the list, and their username and password. Additionally, notes can be added.

#### 2FA Support
RememBear recently added support for second factor authentication (2FA). 2FA makes logins more secure by adding the requirement for a time-synchronized one time password (OTP) which can be obtained from an OTP-generating device such as Google Authenticator or Authy.

RememBear has an option to scan the private key for a 2FA service and can automatically detect when a service is prompting for 2FA entry and enter the generated code.

#### Master Password Protection
The RememBear vault is designed to be used to store users’ most sensitive information, such as secure notes and login details. In order to add a further layer of protection, the application itself is secured by a master password. In the event that users were to get locked out of their computer, for instance, thieves would be unable to log in without supplying this credential.

#### Achievements
Let’s face it. There are probably better things we could all be thinking about than worrying about how to store our passwords. In order to make the whole process of password management a little bit more fun, RememBear makes liberal use of gamification, starting with its iconic bear who peers over you while you type in passwords. RememBear also features an achievements system by which users are “rewarded” for making use of the product. Once users have achieved more than 5 levels they receive a $6 discount on RememBear Premium.

### Ease of Use

Like its sister product TunnelBear VPN, RememBear is designed for users that want a product that “just works” without having to tinker with too many settings under the hood. Remembear is quick and easy to set up, consisting of a single installation file to get the program running. If users want to add an additional device and keep the passwords in sync, RememBear will display a QR code which can be scanned from a smartphone in order to quickly identify the account and streamline the installation process.

### Detection Rates and Reliability

Anybody entrusting their key login credentials to a service needs to be sure that their data is safe. RememBear stores all user information on servers based in Canada and uses AES 256 bit encryption end-to-end. This means that the data sits on the server while encrypted — so nobody at the company has access to it (only the user has the decryption key). Additionally, RememBear is independently audited by Cure53, a Germany cybersecurity firm which independently assesses the security of websites and the infrastructure which they run. The output of the testing process is public so users can have full faith that the information being presented was the output of a gruelling testing process.

### Help and Support

RememBear’s friendly team of support bears is available to provide assistance with all issues related to using your account. The system prompts users for more information about the particular issue they are experiencing so that the query can be routed as quickly as possible to the right representative and the waiting time can be cut down.

The system then works by a ticket updating system. It is a fast and efficient way for users to get help.

For those concerned with finding a simple but effective solution for managing their passwords, then RememBear is a great and highly recommended option. Its simple and gamified user interface does not mean that it’s not powerful: there’s support for 2FA as well as biometric identification. And on the affordable Premium subscription users can quickly sync passwords between unlimited vaults.
